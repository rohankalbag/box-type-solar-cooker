# Design and assembly of a fully functional box type solar cooker

Course Project - Fundamentals of Energy Engineering - EN 110 - Spring Semester 2020

## **Course Instructor - Prof S.B Kedare**

### Group Project by Rohan Rajesh Kalbag and Aabir Lal Biswas

- Designed and Assembled a fully functional Box Type Solar Cooker

- Wrote a program in Arduino IDE to monitor the temperature of the Box Type Solar Cooker using LM 35 Analog Temperature Sensor, plotted its heating curve using Python (matplotlib.pyplot library) and
calculated its steady state temperature.

- The code for that can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/rohankalbag/Box-Type-Solar-Cooker-Design-Project/blob/main/Sensor.ino">Arduino Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rohankalbag/Box-Type-Solar-Cooker-Design-Project/blob/main/Graph%20Plotter.ipynb">Python Code</a>

- The report can be found <a href="https://github.com/rohankalbag/Box-Type-Solar-Cooker-Design-Project/blob/main/Solar%20Cooker%20Report.pdf">here</a> 

- Calculated its performance parameters and First Figure of Merit F1
